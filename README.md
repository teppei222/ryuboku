I made it for practice of Streamlit.

A program that measures the number of round bars from an image
When you put an image in the sidebar, 
the analysis result is displayed on the screen on the right.

If the size of the image or the diameter of the round bar is different, 
the number of recognitions will change, 
so parameter adjustment is required for that side.

If anyone wants to extract a circle with the Hough transform, 
I would appreciate it if you could refer to it.
